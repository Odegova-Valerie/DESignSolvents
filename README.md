# DESignSolvents
Welcome to DESignSolvents, the machine learning platform for predicting the properties of deep eutectic solvents. It provides the open access to database of deep eutectic solvent properties as well as tools for predicting and visualizing them. Our models successfully forecast a variety of parameters, including density, viscosity, and melting point by utilizing advanced algorithms and data analysis approaches.


Deep eutectic solvents are developing as a promising alternative to traditional solvents; however, it can be challenging to forecast their properties using conventional techniques. Our platform offers a fast, reliable, and cost-effective solution, enabling researchers and industry professionals to make informed decisions about the use of deep eutectic solvents. We are constantly expanding the database and improving our models to ensure that they provide the most accurate predictions.
